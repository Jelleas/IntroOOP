# Chapter 1 <br/> Power Up
Welcome to Understanding Computers and the Internet! So glad you could make it. Let's begin with a story. There's a good chance you're sitting at or near a computer right now, whether that be a laptop, tablet, or smartphone. At some point during the day, you hit the power button on one of those devices and watched as the screen lit up and your computer came to life. Pressing that button kicked off something known as the __boot process__, which wakes up all the hardware components that make up your computer and starts up all of the software programs necessary to bring up your desktop.

First, all of your computer's __hardware__, the physical components that make up your machine, has to kick into gear.

Here's a photo of a motherboard from a 2007 Acer desktop computer.
