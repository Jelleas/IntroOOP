# PROBLEM SET 1

### Academic Honesty

All work that you do toward fulfillment of this course’s expectations must be your own unless collaboration
is explicitly allowed by the staff. Viewing, requesting, or copying another individual’s
work or lifting material from a book, magazine, website, or other source—even in part—and presenting
it as your own constitutes academic dishonesty, as does showing or giving your work, even
in part, to another student.
Similarly is dual submission academic dishonesty: you may not submit the same or similar work
to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another. Nor may you provide or make
available solutions to homework or exams to individuals who take or may take this course in the
future. Moreover, submission of any work that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a
job) must be approved by the staff.
If in doubt as to the appropriateness of some act, contact the staff. All forms of academic dishonesty
are dealt with harshly.

i. What the component is called
ii. What the component is used for (e.g., what devices plug into it)
